# Creative Coding

This repo contains some examples that I like from [Ira Greenberg's Processing book](https://www.amazon.com/Processing-Creative-Coding-Computational-Foundation/dp/159059617X). The examples are going to be added over time.

## How to run these examples

1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/).
2. Download/clone this repo.
3. Open Processing.
4. Click "Open" from the file menu bar to load .pde files from the repo you just cloned.
5. Click the run button to see the code in action.
